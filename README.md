# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains a few tricky algorithms which are common in interviews.
Also solving these problems will open a door to a variety of other questions which are based on this.

I'll try to mention problems which are related to each other so that building co-relation is easy.

For any help regarding these you can contact me for guidance at **_coding.with.binaries@gmail.com_**
